GAME SUMMARY

Create a highly polished, visually juicy, action-based educational game designed to help students master physics, chemistry, and biology topics.
The game is divided into micro-units, where each micro-unit is its own level, challenge, or mission.
The game should feel like a fast arcade adventure + learning tool hybrid.

The design priorities are:

Addictive gameplay

Satisfying moment-to-moment feedback

Progression via badges, coins, XP

Replayability

Quick learning bursts (30–60s each)

🌍 CORE GAMEPLAY

Players move through a world map of micro-units. Each level focuses on a specific science target.
Levels combine:

Action

Physics/chemistry puzzles

Reaction-time challenges

Problem-solving

Memory tasks

Drag-and-drop interactions

Mini quizzes disguised as battles

Each correct answer creates exciting game feedback (screen shake, flashes, slow-mo, etc.).

📚 CONTENT — MICRO-UNITS (EVERY LINE = A LEVEL)

Use these learning targets as individual levels, grouped into worlds.
